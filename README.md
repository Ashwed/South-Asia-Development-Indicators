# South Asia Development Indicators Data Analysis

This mini-project focuses on using __ggplot__ visualization package in R  to explore development indicators of South Asian countries - Population, Economic Growth and Environmental Development. I investigated how South Asian countries have developed with respect to these indicators from 1960-2014 and how each individual nation has performed as compared to its counterparts.
